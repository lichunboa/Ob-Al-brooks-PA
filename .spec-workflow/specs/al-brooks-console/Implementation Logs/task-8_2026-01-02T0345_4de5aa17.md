# Implementation Log: Task 8

**Summary:** Completed Task 8 by hardening list performance: `TradeList` now keeps the existing rendering for small lists, but switches to a lightweight virtualized/windowed renderer for large lists (threshold: >200) to avoid heavy DOM work. Also marked Task 8 as complete in the spec tasks list. (Note: the index build status/rebuild/error boundary pieces referenced by Task 8 are already present in the codebase and are exercised by the dashboard.)

## Artifacts

### Components

#### TradeList (virtualized)
- **Purpose:** Keep MVP UX for small lists; use windowing (scrollTop-based slicing + spacers) only for large lists to reduce DOM and improve responsiveness.
- **Location:** .obsidian/plugins/al-brooks-console/src/views/components/TradeList.tsx
- **Exports:** TradeList

### Integrations

- **Description:** Trade list virtualization is purely a render optimization; no data semantics changes.
- **Frontend Component:** TradeList (Dashboard)
- **Backend Endpoint:** N/A (in-process)
- **Data Flow:** TradeIndex emits change → Dashboard passes trades → TradeList renders (virtualized only when large)
